# Specification of Darcs' Patch Theory _Kernel_ in Alloy

In 2010, Iago Abal wrote this specification of [Darcs](http://darcs.net/)' [patch theory](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_Darcs/Patch_theory) _kernel_ in [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/) as course work for the _Formal Methods for Software Engineering_ course at University of Minho. By path theory kernel, we mean the set of _primitive patches_ and associated operations. This formalization does not model _merges_.
